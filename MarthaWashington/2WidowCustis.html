            <p><center>Martha, now a widow, was raising two children and running a plantation. Contrary to the standards of the time, Martha received independent control of her dower inheritance and control of her children’s inheritance— she owned almost 300 slaves and had more than 17,000 acres. She had freedom and power, and was intelligent with her money. Biographers have found evidence of her business transactions with other colonists, and even London merchants.
            <p>In March of 1758, almost a year after Daniel’s death, Martha met George Washington. There are conflicting stories of how they met, though it is believed George Washington purposely stopped by Martha’s home on his way to Williamsburg. There is no doubt that they hadn’t heard of each other— Martha was young, attractive, rich, and most importantly, available. And George Washington was a young Colonel, known throughout the colonies for his courage, fairness, and leadership during the French and Indian War.
            <p>Martha had already married for status, and though she and Daniel had had a great life together, it was over. Remarriage in Colonial America was quite common, and at 26, Martha was still quite young— for Martha, however, finances were not an issue. She could marry for love.

            <p>It is said Martha fell for George as fast as he did for her. He was 6’3 and strong, brave, kind, and softspoken; she was lovely, fair and petite, and warmhearted, ready to start anew— it is not hard to imagine they fell in love.
            <p>Within months, Martha and George starting planning a future together, and they were married on 6 January 1759, less than a year after their first meeting. Shortly after the marriage, the Washingtons left New Kent for George Washington’s family home, Mount Vernon.

            <p>To the utter dismay of Martha and George, Martha was unable to get pregnant. As Martha had already had four children, modern historians and scientists feel the infertility is from George. Out of his many illness as a young man, small pox or tuberculosis seem like the most likely culprits for his infertility. George treated Martha’s children as his own, favoring his stepdaughter as Martha favored her son. At this point, George had resigned his military commission, and the Washington’s lived happily at Mount Vernon.
            <p>Tragedy struck in 1773. Patsy, who had been suffering from seizures from a young age, passed away after a seemly normal seizure. Martha now had only one living child. In a letter to Burwell Bassett, Martha’s brother-in-law, George Washington wrote about Patsy’s death: “Yesterday removed the Sweet Innocent Girl into a more happy, & peaceful abode than any she has met with in the afflicted Path she hitherto has trod. She rose from Dinner about four Oclock, in better health and spirits than she appeared to have been in for some time; soon after which she was siezd with one of her usual Fits, & expired in it, in less than two Minutes without uttering a Word, a groan, or scarce a Sigh. This Sudden, and unexpected blow, I scarce need add has almost reduced my poor Wife to the lowest ebb of Misery.” CITE
            <p>During this same year, Jacky had been courting a young Eleanor Calvert, and in 1774 they were married. Martha was too distraught over her daughter’s death to attend the wedding.</center></p>
