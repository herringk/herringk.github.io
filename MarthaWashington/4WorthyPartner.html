            <h1><center>A Worthy Partner, Now Alone</center></h1>
            <p><center>The Washington’s happy retirement wasn’t to last long. Less than three years after stepping down, George Washington fell sick and passed away on the 14th of December in 1799. After his death, Martha proclaimed, "’Tis well…. All is now over. I shall soon follow him! I have no more trials to pass through!" CITE
            <p>As you can imagine, she received hundreds of condolence letters. Pictured here is Abigail Adams’ and Martha’s response. “Whilst in unison with the Sympathetic Sorrow of a Nation I unite in Deploring the Loss it has sustained; of a Father, Friend, and Benefactor. I intreat, Madam, that you would permit a Heart deeply penetrated with your Loss, and sharing personally in your Grief to mingle with you the Tears which flow for the much Loved partner of all your joys and Sorrow’s. Deep as is the wound you have sustained, and irreparable as the Stroke must be, May that Religion to which you have ever been an armament afford you Support, and from that Being who has promised to Be a Husband to the widow; may you derive Consolation is the fervent prayer of your truly Sympathizing Friend.” CITE
            <p>Martha’s response: “Accept the thanks of a heart opprest with sorrow but grateful for your friendly sympathising letter To that Almighty power who alone can heal the wounds he inflicts, I look for consolation & Fortitude. May you long very long enjoy the happiness you now possess, and never know affliction like mine. With prayers for your happiness, I remain your sincere friend.” CITE
            <p>Martha didn’t attend George Washington’s funeral, as she was too distraught. She was all alone— having outlived nearly all of her family. She removed herself from the bedroom they had shared for 4o years to a smaller room. Three years later, Martha passed away, surrounded by friends and family around noon at Mount Vernon, on the 22nd of May in 1802. It was a life well lived— a worthy partner of George Washington, and a great somebody in her own right.</center></p>
