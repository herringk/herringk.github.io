            <p>Martha Dandridge was born on the 2nd of June in 1731 at Chestnut Grove in New Kent County, Va. She was the first child of Jack and Frances Jones Dandridge, who eventually had seven more children. Martha, though the oldest, outlived all of her siblings, and would eventually outlive her children, and her two husbands.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, information about the first 20 years of Martha’s life can only be guessed at— we can assume, like most women of the time, that she received no formal education, though she did learn to read and write. Instead, her studies consisted of the domestic arts— music, dancing, sewing, and household management; she was also considered to be an excellent horsewoman. Her later skills included plantation management, business, and medicine—  and so it is clear that it cannot be said that Martha was uneducated. </p>
            <h1>Mrs. Daniel Parke Custis</h1>
            <p>At 18, Martha began to be courted by Daniel Parke Custis, a man many years her senior. Unfortunately, John Parke Custis, his father, disapproved of the Dandridge family, as though they were wealthy, they weren’t wealthy enough to marry into his family. It is said that after Martha had a private word with Daniel’s father, he consented to the marriage. Martha became Ms. Custis on 15 May 1750— she was almost 19, and Daniel was 38.

            <p>They moved to the Custis plantation, White House, four miles from Chestnut Grove. They had their first child in 51, a boy, and their second in 53, a girl. The following year, their first child, Daniel, succumbed to malaria and passed away. That same year, Martha gave birth to John Parke Custis, her only child to live to adulthood. Two years later, Martha and Daniel had their last child together, a daughter, named Martha Parke Custis. The next year, in 57, their eldest daughter, Frances, fell sick and joined her brother Daniel in the family plot in Queen’s Creek, Va. Later that year, Daniel and John become sick, and Daniel ultimately passes away, leaving Martha a widow to two small children at the age of 26.</center></p>
