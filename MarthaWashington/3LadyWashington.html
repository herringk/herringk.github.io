            <h1><center>The Revolutionary War</center></h1>
            <p>Everything changed the following year. It was 1775 and the colonies were at war. Martha, with a sense of foreboding, knew change was near when everything became taxed relentlessly. And George, who only wanted to ride and farm and be with his family, was called to action. Because of his prodigious skills, the Colonel began the General and led the colonists to war, and eventually to victory.
            <p>The Army had been in Cambridge since the summer, and morale was already low— and the proclaimed war hadn’t even been going on a year yet. George stayed at John Vassel’s home, a loyalist who had fled back to England at the start of the war. That fall, Martha was called to Cambridge, Massachusetts to stay with George and the rest of the Continental Army at headquarters. By this point, Martha had realized that this was not going to be a quick war— and if George couldn’t go back to Mount Vernon, then she would go to him.

            <p>Upon her arrival to headquarters, there was much pomp and ceremony. She was the General’s wife! She was loved and adored, the soldiers flocked to her, and she took care of everyone. She motivated the troops by motivating her husband. However, Martha wrote to one of her dear friends, Elizabeth Ramsay, how she really felt:
              <p><i>“Every person seems to be cheerfull and happy here – some days we have a number of cannon and shells from Boston and Bunkers Hill, but it does not seem to surprise any one but me; I confess I shuder every time I hear the sound of a gun.</i><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
              <p>And yet she stayed for four months. And for the next seven years, she would spend every winter with George and his Army. We would call that courage.

            <p>Eventually the war ends, the victors the newly found United States of America. The Washingtons returned to Mount Vernon, bringing Eleanor’s two youngest with them, to be raised and adopted by Martha and George. Martha and George become parents once more to Martha’s grandchildren, Eleanor, called Nelly, and George Washington Parke Custis, called Wash.</center></p>
            <h1><center>The Presidency</center></h1>
            <p>To Martha’s dismay, it seemed that the colonies could not rule themselves, could not get along— and once again, George Washington was called to duty, and he obliged. In a unanimous vote, the General became the President. They left Mount Vernon and moved to 3 Cherry Street in Manhattan on the 23rd of April in 1789.

              </figure>
              <p>After living at 3 Cherry Street for one year, the first family moved to Broadway, and then less than a year later, to Philadelphia. A permanent capitol was being built further south, in the marshy lands donated by Virginia and Maryland, which was to be known as the District of Columbia— though the Washingtons would stay in Philadelphia for the rest of George’s presidency.
            <p>Eventually, two terms passed and the Washingtons could go home. They went back to Mount Vernon with the intent of living there for the remainder of their lives— farming, enjoying their grandchildren, and now great grandchildren.</center></p>
